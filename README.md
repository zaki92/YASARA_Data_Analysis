# YASARA_Data_Analysis

Reads raw YASARA simulation data for hbonds, and outputs the counts as a fraction
of time for all interfacial hydrogen bonds. Also provides mean energy and distance
for interfacial hbonds. Optional single column outputs also exist for further anal-
ysis if needed. 
Input : Excel file (.xlsx) output from YASARA (provided in GitHub as input data)
Output : Excel file(s) (.xlsx) with compiled interfacial hbond data (line 89)
Comment/Uncomment where indicated for optional outputs. 
Optional Outputs : All data single column (line 44)
                   All interfacial hbonds single column (line 58)
                   All distinct interfacial hbonds single column (line 69)
                   All distinct interfacial hbonds with only counts (line 78)
